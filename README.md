# âœ” REAL TIME HUMAN DETECTION & COUNTING

In this python project, the inputs are given through Webcam or you can give your own video or images. This is an intermediate level deep learning project on computer vision, which will help to master the concepts of python and Data Science.
<br><br>
***
**ðŸ“ŒREQUIREMENTS :**

The project in Python requires to have basic knowledge of python programming and the OpenCV library,

**OpenCV**: A strong library used for machine learning'

**Imutils**: To Image Processing

**Numpy**: Used for Scientific Computing. Image is stored in a numpy array.

**Argparse**: Used to give input in command line.
<br><br>
***
**Feature descriptor or the model used :**
**Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptor (HOG)**

HOG is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. This is one of the most popular techniques for object detection, to our fortune, OpenCV has already been implemented in an efficient way to combine the HOG Descriptor algorithm with Support Vector Machine or SVM.

<br>
There are some methods created for detection through inputs (image, video, camera) :
 <br><br>
 **DetectByCamera()**
 
 **DetectByPathVideo()**
 
 **DetectByPathimage()**
